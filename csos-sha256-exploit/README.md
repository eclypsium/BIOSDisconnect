DellCsosLauncher.efi sha256 overflow payload generator

This script was used to generate payloads to insert into the sha256 field
of the json downloaded by DellCsosLauncher.efi.

Unique json files are requested per-model, so individual payloads can be 
provided for each vulnerable model of device.

Things that will likely need to be changed to get this working with other
models are the pattern for SecurityStubDxe, the offset from the pattern to
the mNumberOfSecurity2Handlers varible to disable Secure Boot, and the
search ranges to find it and where DellCsosLauncher.efi is loaded.
